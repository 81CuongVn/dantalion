# 🦁 Dantalion: Core library

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40kurone-kito%2Fdantalion-core.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40kurone-kito%2Fdantalion-core)
[![lerna](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20with-lerna-cc00ff.svg)](https://lerna.js.org/)

“Dantalion” is the seventy-first demon in the demonological grimoire,
_[the Lesser Key of Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lesser_Key_of_Solomon)_.
He teaches all kinds of academic knowledge, but he can also read and
manipulate others’ hearts.

If you can predict the other person’s character, you can increase the
possibility of controlling the other person’s will. This package provides
a function that infers the personality details from the specified birthday.
By using this package, you can quickly implement birthday divination in
your Node.js apps. Its calculation is using the method of
_Four Pillars of Destiny (Ba-Zi)_.

## Note

- OS independent and dependent free.
- This package can specify a birthday within the range from February 1,
  1873, to December 31, 2050.
- This package does not consider time zones. If you are not satisfied with
  the inferred personality, moving the date back and forth may solve.
