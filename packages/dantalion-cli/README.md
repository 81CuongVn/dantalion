# ü¶Å Dantalion: CLI version

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40kurone-kito%2Fdantalion-cli.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40kurone-kito%2Fdantalion-cli)
[![lerna](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20with-lerna-cc00ff.svg)](https://lerna.js.org/)

‚ÄúDantalion‚Äù is the seventy-first demon in the demonological grimoire,
_[the Lesser Key of Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lesser_Key_of_Solomon)_.
He teaches all kinds of academic knowledge, but he can also read and
manipulate others‚Äô hearts.

If you can predict the other person‚Äôs character, you can increase the
possibility of controlling the other person‚Äôs will. This package provides
a function that infers the personality details from the specified birthday.
By using this package, you can quickly implement birthday divination in
your Node.js apps. Its calculation is using the method of
_Four Pillars of Destiny (Ba-Zi)_.

## Note

- This package can specify a birthday within the range from February 1,
  1873, to December 31, 2050.
- This package does not consider time zones. If you are not satisfied with
  the inferred personality, moving the date back and forth may solve.

## Usage

- Require: Node.js >= v12.1 (Strongly recommend: >= 14.17)
- OS independent (It's a terminal app)

Dantalion will **no more support by Node.js version v12.x** soon.

For the time being, the app maybe works fine in v12.x (will with a few warnings on install).
However, several factors helped us to let go of the v12.x, including the following:

1. We want to migrate our distribution from CommonJS to ES Modules in the future.
2. The web playground crashes in specific environments such as Apple Silicon.
   - We considered separating the web app version from monorepo and
     moving it to a separate repository but decided it would be less
     expensive to separate the v12.x support for the reasons in _1_.

## Major categories of personality

There are three main types of humans personality: ‚ÄúFocused on authority‚Äù, ‚ÄúFocused on economically‚Äù, and ‚ÄúFocused on humanely‚Äù.

### Focused on economically

    * This personality type is the pursues efficiency, with the underlying ego being for the sake of one's own wealth.
    * They tend to be specs-oriented and tend to disrespect brands. However, some rare people consider brands to be a kind of specs and place importance on them.
    * They cannot listen to long conversations very well. So they try to understand only the main points and tend to think or say, ‚Äúin a nutshell...‚Äù.
