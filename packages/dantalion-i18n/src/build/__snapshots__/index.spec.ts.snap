- 文系脳タイプは、総じて長話をちゃんとニコニコ最初から最後まで聞ける傾向があります。ただし**頭に入っているかどうかは別の話**。
- 話を端折ると“なんで？”となり、その後の話が理解できなくなりがちです。家族で映画とか見る時、勝手にシークバーいじって顰蹙買うことも。

- 自分語りが長くなりがちですので、適切に話のディレクションをしてあげると効果大です。
- 例えば初参加のイベントなど、権威を持たない門外の場所に不安を覚える傾向があります。エスコートしてあげると“その場での権威ある人”と認めてついていくようになります。
- 実績タイプに対して、経験を否定することは避けましょう。それがたとえ誤りであっても無用の軋轢を生じさせます。

- 自分語りが長くなりがちですので、適切に話のディレクションをしてあげると効果大です。
- 例えば初参加のイベントなど、権威を持たない門外の場所に不安を覚える傾向があります。エスコートしてあげると“その場での権威ある人”と認めてついていくようになります。
- 実績タイプに対して、経験を否定することは避けましょう。それがたとえ誤りであっても無用の軋轢を生じさせます。

### リーダー・勇者タイプ

### 文系脳タイプ

### 理系脳タイプ

- **己の富のため**を根底のエゴとし、効率性を追求するタイプです。
- スペック至上主義の傾向があり、ブランドものを軽視する傾向が強いです。ただし、ブランドも一種のスペックと考え、重視する人も稀にいます。

#### このタイプに対する攻略法

- アート脳タイプ・理系脳タイプ・文系脳タイプでそれぞれ三すくみのような関係があり、文系脳タイプよりアート脳タイプを説得できやすい傾向があります。

- **興味ある話**を聞くと、真剣に話を聞くあまり、怒り顔になるなど、至極**険悪な空気になりやすい**傾向があります。ここで諦めずにしっかり話すと、最後には納得してくれるケースが多いです。

"# Dantalion: 誕生日が Thu Jul 10 1873 の人の性格と、取扱方法

## 性格の大分類

人の性格は大きく 3 つ、アート脳タイプ・理系脳タイプ・文系脳タイプに分類できます。

### 理系脳タイプ

- **己の富のため**を根底のエゴとし、効率性を追求するタイプです。
- スペック至上主義の傾向があり、ブランドものを軽視する傾向が強いです。ただし、ブランドも一種のスペックと考え、重視する人も稀にいます。
- 理系脳タイプは、**長話をあまり聞けません**。“**つまりこういうことだよね？**”と、脳内で**要点だけかいつまんで理解**しようとします。

#### このタイプに対する攻略法

- アート脳タイプ・理系脳タイプ・文系脳タイプでそれぞれ三すくみのような関係があり、文系脳タイプよりアート脳タイプを説得できやすい傾向があります。
- 話をする際は事前に重要なところを吟味して、**要点だけ**を伝え、残りは質疑応答にするか、資料などにして渡すなどすると、話が通じやすいです。
- **興味ある話**を聞くと、真剣に話を聞くあまり、怒り顔になるなど、至極**険悪な空気になりやすい**傾向があります。ここで諦めずにしっかり話すと、最後には納得してくれるケースが多いです。
- 理系脳タイプは、儲け話に対するアレルギーを持つ人が少なく、ぼかさず直球的に踏み込んでも大丈夫です。ただし**数値に強い**傾向があるため、納得のいくビジネスモデルやエビデンスを用意しないと、納得してくれないでしょう。

## 素質

より詳細な、天性の性格。これは 12 種類に分類します。 人はその中から 3 種類の素質をもち、状況によって現れる素質が異なります。

1. **本性**: 根底にある性格
1. **装い**: 相手を信用しない時に出る性格

### リーダー・勇者タイプ

### アート脳タイプ

- **己の権威のため**を根底のエゴとし、将来性を追求するタイプです。
- アート脳タイプは、**長話を聞けません**。重要な話でないと判断した途端、スマホをいじったり、居眠りしたりなど、**露骨に話を聞かなく**なります。

- 漠然とした、具現化しにくい不安を持っている人が多く、またその不安を原動力に転嫁しやすい特性があります。

- 話を持ちかける際は、事前に重要なところを吟味して、そこに対する**インパクト**の強さを**すっごい強調して説明**すると、話が通じやすいです。
- アート脳タイプは、自分の抱える不安をバネにした行動力を持っています。やや邪道ですが、不安を与えてからベネフィットを提案する、**鞭飴**作戦が有効です。

"# Dantalion: 誕生日が Sat Nov 15 1873 の人の性格と、取扱方法

## 性格の大分類

人の性格は大きく 3 つ、アート脳タイプ・理系脳タイプ・文系脳タイプに分類できます。

### 文系脳タイプ

- **己の人格のため**を根底のエゴとし、社会性を追求するタイプです。
- 多くのことに対し、人柄に重点を置きがちで、店とかで商品を選ぶ際、スペック関係ないのに、販売員の人柄で決めてしまったりする傾向があります。
- 文系脳タイプは、総じて長話をちゃんとニコニコ最初から最後まで聞ける傾向があります。ただし**頭に入っているかどうかは別の話**。
- 話を端折ると“なんで？”となり、その後の話が理解できなくなりがちです。家族で映画とか見る時、勝手にシークバーいじって顰蹙買うことも。

#### このタイプに対する攻略法

- アート脳タイプ・理系脳タイプ・文系脳タイプでそれぞれ三すくみのような関係があり、アート脳タイプより理系脳タイプを説得できやすい傾向があります。
- 話をする際は、**起承転結を順番通り**、冗長な補足も都度つけて説明すると話が通りやすいです。端折ると“何で？”となって、その後の話が理解できなくなりがちです。
- またこのタイプは、**わかってなくてもニコニコ聞いてしまう**ので、要所要所で確認をとるとベターでしょう。
- **人柄や、人の良さに訴えかける**と弱い傾向があります。また、本人のためというより、本人の周りの人のため、みたいな大義名分で攻めると説得しやすいでしょう。

1. **本性**: 根底にある性格
1. **装い**: 相手を信用しない時に出る性格

- 例えば初参加のイベントなど、権威を持たない門外の場所に不安を覚える傾向があります。エスコートしてあげると“その場での権威ある人”と認めてついていくようになります。
